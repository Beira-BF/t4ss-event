<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S2"><term id="T1" sem="Bacterium">Agrobacterium</term> <term id="T3" sem="Cell_component">Ti ( tumor-inducing ) plasmids</term> , the causative agents of crown gall disease , fall into four genetic goups based on the patterns of octopine and nopaline synthesis ( by crown gall tumors ) and catabolism ( by <term id="T2" sem="Bacterium">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</term> ) for which they are responsible .</sentence>
<sentence id="S3">Two classes of <term id="T4" sem="Cell_component">Ti plasmids</term> induce tumors that synthesize neither octopine nor nopaline .</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">The existence of these <term id="T5" sem="Cell_component">Ti plasmids</term> challenged the view that opines such as octopine and nopaline play a central role in crown gall biology .</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">We now report the occurrence of an opine in tumors induced by one of these classes of <term id="T6" sem="Cell_component">Ti plasmids</term> , the &quot; null-type &quot; plasmids typified by pTi Bo542 .</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">The opine was purified by biological enrichment based on its utilization by bacteria containing pTi Bo542 but not by bacteria lacking a <term id="T7" sem="Cell_component">Ti plasmid</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">The mass spectrum and biological properties of this opine are identical to those of agropine , an opine recently discovered in octopine-type tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">We propose that null-type <term id="T8" sem="Cell_component">Ti plasmids</term> now be named for their signal opine , agropine-type <term id="T9" sem="Cell_component">Ti plasmids</term> .</sentence>
