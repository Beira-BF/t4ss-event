</ArticleTitle>
<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S2">From the analysis of 251 prokaryotic genomes stored in public databases , the 761 , 260 deduced proteins were used to reconstruct a complete set of bacterial proteic families .</sentence>
<sentence id="S3">Using the new Overlap algorithm , we have partitioned the Protein Homology Network ( PHN ) , where the proteins are the nodes and the links represent homology relationships .</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">The algorithm identifies the densely connected regions of the PHN that define the families of homologous proteins , here called PHN-Families , recognizing the phylogenetic relationships embedded in the network .</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">By direct comparison with a manually curated dataset , we assessed that this classification algorithm generates data of quality similar to a human expert .</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">Then , we explored the network to identify families involved in the <term id="T1" sem="Biological_process">assembly</term> of Type III and <term id="T10" sem="Cell_component">Type IV secretion systems</term> ( <term id="T11" sem="Cell_component">T3SS</term> and <term id="T12" sem="Cell_component">T4SS</term> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">We noticed that , beside a core of conserved functions ( eight proteins for T3SS , seven for T4SS ) , a variable set of accessory components is always present ( one to nine for <term id="T13" sem="Cell_component">T3SS</term> , one to five for <term id="T14" sem="Cell_component">T4SS</term> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">Each member of the core corresponds to a single PHN-Family , while accessory proteins are distributed among different pure families .</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">The PHN-Family classification suggests that <term id="T15" sem="Cell_component">T3SS</term> and <term id="T16" sem="Cell_component">T4SS</term> have been <term id="T2" sem="Biological_process">assembled</term> through a step-wise , discontinuous process , by complementing the conserved core with subgroups of nonconserved proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">Such genetic modules , independently recruited and probably tuned on specific effectors , contribute to the functional specialization of these organelles to different microenvironments .</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">Introduction</sentence>
<sentence id="S12">The seminal observation of Margareth O . Dayhoff [ 1 , 2 ] that proteins evolved from a common ancestor into families [ 2 , 3 ] has been recognized as central in the speciation and diversification processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S13">In addition , the horizontal transmission of genetic material between different species is frequent , and has shaped the evolution of many living organisms [ 4 , 5 ] , suggesting that the concept of the phylogenetic tree should be replaced by a phylogenetic network , where connections between different clades occur due to horizontal gene transfer [ 6 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="S14">These nontrivial inheritance patterns are more easily detectable once each gene product has been classified in a protein family , and correlated evolutionary history of different systems or system components become visible .</sentence>
<sentence id="S15">We have investigated the problem of reconstructing the evolutionary relationships amongst proteins and of classifying them into families from a topological point of view , by defining the Protein Homology Network ( PHN ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S16">In the PHN , proteins are seen as nodes connected by links that represent the homology relations inferred by sequence similarity .</sentence>
<sentence id="S17">In such a representation , protein families should appear as dense clusters disconnected from the rest of the network .</sentence>
<sentence id="S18">Since alignment search algorithms can only approximate the real genetic distance between proteins , false or missing links alter the ideal structure of the network .</sentence>
<sentence id="S19">Furthermore , proteins resulting from the fusion of two or more protein domains show homology with members of different families .</sentence>
<sentence id="S20">As a consequence , regions of the network with a higher density of links are still recognizable , but family boundaries are more difficult to identify .</sentence>
<sentence id="S21">We have used the intrinsic transitivity of true homology relationships to define a new similarity measure among proteins , which allows us to identify unambiguously the densely connected regions of the network , which we define as PHN-Families .</sentence>
<sentence id="S22">Based on this measure , we have devised an algorithm able to classify large sets of proteins into PHN-Families without human intervention .</sentence>
<sentence id="S23">To demonstrate the potential of this approach , we have studied the classification into PHN-Families of the structural components of two complex bacterial organelles , namely Type III [ 7-10 ] and Type IV [ 11-14 ] secretion systems ( T3SS and T4SS , respectively ) , which are <term id="T17" sem="Cell_component">contact-dependent export systems</term> widely spread among pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="S24"><term id="T18" sem="Cell_component">T3SS</term> and <term id="T19" sem="Cell_component">T4SS</term> are ancestrally related to other bacterial organelles , flagella [ 15 , 16 ] , and the <term id="T20" sem="Cell_component">conjugative apparatus</term> , respectively [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="S25">Both systems are frequently <term id="T3" sem="Biological_process">transferred</term> horizontally between microorganisms , and some of their constituents form multidomain fusion proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="S26">Experimental evidence and comparative analysis of both <term id="T21" sem="Cell_component">T3SS</term> [ 7 , 16 ] and <term id="T22" sem="Cell_component">T4SS</term> [ 11 , 13 ] have defined a set of characteristic functions that are conserved in the majority of known secretion systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="S27">In both cases , the PHN-Families allow us to quickly identify a conserved core of proteins , shared with the ancestrally related apparatuses , which are present in more than 120 bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="S28">At the same time we find that many other constituents , considered functionally homologous , are separated by a genetic divergence incompatible with a single family .</sentence>
<sentence id="S29">An evolutionary profiling of both apparatuses , based on the PHN-Family classification of their members , suggests that <term id="T23" sem="Cell_component">T3SS</term> and <term id="T24" sem="Cell_component">T4SS</term> have been <term id="T4" sem="Biological_process">assembled</term> through a step-wise , discontinuous process , by complementing the conserved core with distant genetic units .</sentence>
<sentence id="S30">Such modules , often independently recruited , and probably tuned on specific effectors , determine the functional specialization of these organelles to different microenvironments .</sentence>
<sentence id="S31">Results</sentence>
<sentence id="S32">Results are organized as follows : in the first subsection we demonstrate that the PHN is formed by densely connected regions , which we identify as families of homologous proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="S33">In the second we describe the algorithm that identifies such families ( see Figure 1 ) , and we assess their quality .</sentence>
<sentence id="S34">In the third subsection we analyze the PHN-Families classification of the <term id="T25" sem="Cell_component">T3SS</term> and <term id="T26" sem="Cell_component">T4SS structural components</term> , and finally we use PHN-Families to suggest a model for the diversification of the secretory apparatuses .</sentence>
<sentence id="S35">The Protein Homology Network</sentence>
<sentence id="S36">We formed the PHN by representing the proteins as nodes and connecting two nodes if their symmetric BLAST [ 18 ] E-value was smaller than a given cutoff , e ( see Materials and Methods and Figure 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S37">The network was formed by distinct , connected components , i.e. , groups of nodes connected by a path .</sentence>
<sentence id="S38">At the lowest values of e , the network components were small and densely connected , including only proteins with very similar amino acid sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="S39">By increasing the value of e , many of these groups of nodes merged , and the network became composed of large connected components , including proteins belonging to different families ( see Figure 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S40">This effect is known in network science as the &apos;&apos;emergence of the giant component , &apos;&apos; and becomes dramatic for high values of e when more than 60 % of the proteins belong to a single connected component [ 19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="S41">By measuring g , the index of compactness of the connected components , we see that for growing values of e these large connected components became increasingly sparse , i.e. , most pairs of nodes were not directly connected by a link ( see Materials and Methods and Figure 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S42">At the same time , the clustering index , C [ 19 ] , that is , a local measure of the degree of clustering of a network , varied from 0.95 to 0.84 ( see Materials and Methods and Figure 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S43">These values of C are much larger than expected in the case of a random network [ 20 ] , indicating a dense local structure , as found in other real world networks [ 19 , 21 , 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="S44">Taken together , these findings suggest that at the highest values of e investigated , the PHN was formed by many compact regions , which are loosely connected by few links .</sentence>
<sentence id="S45">We set the homology cutoff at the most permissive value , e = 10-5 , and we identified the compact regions of the PHN with the protein families .</sentence>
<sentence id="S46">In this way , the problem of classifying a set of proteins into families was reduced to the problem of distinguishing the links that are internal to these compact regions from those connecting two different groups of proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="S47">Protein Families from the PHN Topology</sentence>
<sentence id="S48">To identify protein families , for each pair of nodes i , j of the PHN , we computed the overlap , hij ( see Materials and Methods ) , that measures the similarity between the sets of nearest neighbors of the two nodes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S49">Nodes within the same family have high hij values , while nodes belonging to different families , having few common nearest neighbors , have low hij values .</sentence>
<sentence id="S50">We rewired the PHN by connecting pairs of nodes that had an overlap above a threshold value h ( see Materials and Methods ) , and computed the connected components of the resulting network .</sentence>
<sentence id="S51">For small values of h , the network was still dominated by a single connected component that included a large fraction of the nodes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S52">By increasing the cutoff h , the size of the largest cluster sharply decreased , and the giant component became disconnected into a set of smaller , compact subnetworks.</sentence>
<sentence id="S53">For different values of h , we evaluated the modularity measure Q [ 23 ] ( see Materials and Methods ) of the resulting partitioning of the network .</sentence>
<sentence id="S54">Q measures the extent to which a partitioning reflects the underlying community structure .</sentence>
<sentence id="S55">After the overlap procedure on the e = 10-5 network , we obtained a maximum Qmax = 0.723 , for h = 0.5 , as shown in Figure 5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="S56">Before applying the overlap procedure , the maximum modularity of the PHN was Q = 0.39 at e = 10-40 .</sentence>
<sentence id="S57">The best values of Q observed in other systems fall in the range Q = 0.3 4 0.7 [ 23 , 24 ] , showing that in the PHN the modular structure is very well-defined .</sentence>
<sentence id="S58">The maximum in Q for h = 0.5 indicates that , by linking nodes that have at least half of their nearest neighbors in common , we partitioned the network into a set of components that best coincide with the densely connected regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="S59">In Figure 5 we also show the compactness index g , recalculated for different values of h .</sentence>
<sentence id="S60">The value of g grows with h ; for h = 0.5 we obtain g = 0.77 .</sentence>
<sentence id="S61">This value is higher than those obtained before the overlap procedure , and confirms a strict correspondence between the connected components generated by the overlap procedure and the densely interlinked regions of the PHN .</sentence>
<sentence id="S62">We defined PHN-Families as the connected components when h = 0.5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="S63">We found 28 , 226 PHN-Families containing at least two proteins , plus 127 , 856 isolated proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="S64">The giant component of the original homology network was disconnected into 14 , 443 distinct PHN-Families plus 26 , 274 isolated proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="S65">Eleven percent of the connections were removed from the PHN , while the new links introduced represented about 5 % of the connections .</sentence>
<sentence id="S66">To assess the biological relevance of the overlap procedure , we compared added and removed links with Pfam [ 25 ] , a high-quality protein domain classification database ( see Materials and Methods ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S67">A link added to the network by means of the overlap procedure was considered correct iff the two connected proteins shared at least one Pfam domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="S68">The deletion of a link was considered correct if the two connected proteins did not belong to the same Pfam family , or at least one of them was a multidomain protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="S69">For h = 0.5 , 98.5 % of the newly added links connected proteins that shared a classified domain , while more than three fourths of the removed links involved multidomain proteins or proteins with noncompatible classifications ( see Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S70">We conclude that our unsupervised classification has a quality comparable to a classification manually curated by human experts .</sentence>

<sentence id="S74">Core proteins are accompanied by a variable number of accessory proteins belonging to less conserved functional classes , distributed in multiple PHN-Families ( see Table S2 , where we report the number of the corresponding PHN-Families for each functional class , and the total number of proteins included ) .</sentence>

<sentence id="S112">Group II is characterized by the <gene-or-gene-product id="G57">VirB1</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G58">2</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G59">3</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G60">5</gene-or-gene-product> proteins of the pSB102/pIPO2T broad host range plasmids ; group III by the <gene-or-gene-product id="G61">VirB3</gene-or-gene-product> ( and to a minor extent <gene-or-gene-product id="G62">VirB2</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G63">7</gene-or-gene-product> ) proteins of the A. tumefaciens VirB apparatus ; organelles in group IV complement the core set with only one or two accessory proteins ( <gene-or-gene-product id="G64">VirB1</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G65">5</gene-or-gene-product> ) shared with both the A. tumefaciens VirB and the pSB102/pIPO2T operon .</sentence>
<sentence id="S113">In group IV we also found C. jejuni and C. coli <term id="T67" sem="Cell_component">plasmids</term> , whose <gene-or-gene-product id="G66">VirB7</gene-or-gene-product> proteins belong to the same small family as the H. pylori Cag ( group I ) homologues .</sentence>
<sentence id="S114">This incongruence , along with the small <gene-or-gene-product id="G67">VirB6</gene-or-gene-product> family of the Bordetellae <term id="T68" sem="Cell_component">Ptl system</term> and the nonhomogeneous pattern of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G68">VirB1</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G69">2</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G70">3</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G71">5</gene-or-gene-product>/<gene-or-gene-product id="G72">7</gene-or-gene-product> PHN-Families in Agrobacterii , Rhizobii , Bartonellae , and Xylellae of group III , again suggest that distinct genetic units have been recruited independently to complement the core proteins .</sentence>
