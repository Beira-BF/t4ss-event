</ArticleTitle>
<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S2">Rickettsia massiliae is a tick-borne obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria causing spotted fever in humans .</sentence>
<sentence id="S3">Here , we present the sequence of its genome , comprising a 1.3-Mb <term id="T8" sem="Cell_component">circular chromosome</term> and a 15.3-kb <term id="T9" sem="Cell_component">plasmid</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">The chromosome exhibits long-range colinearity with the other Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia genomes , except for a large fragment specific to R. massiliae that contains 14 tra genes presumably involved in <term id="T1" sem="Biological_process"><term id="T10" sem="Cell_component">pilus</term> formation</term> and <term id="T2" sem="Biological_process">conjugal DNA transfer</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">We demonstrate that the <gene-or-gene-product id="G1">tra</gene-or-gene-product> region was acquired recently by lateral gene transfer ( LGT ) from a species related to Rickettsia bellii .</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">Further analysis of the genomic sequences identifies additional candidates of LGT between Rickettsia .</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">Our study indicates that recent LGT between obligate intracellular Rickettsia is more common than previously thought.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">The Rickettsia genus , which includes Rickettsia massiliae , is a group of arthropod-borne , obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria ( Raoult and Roux 1997 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">This genus has been classified into three groups , namely , the typhus group ( TG ) , which includes Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi , the spotted fever group ( SFG ) , which includes Rickettsia rickettsii and Rickettsia conorii , and the Rickettsia bellii group ( Stothard et al. 1994 ; Roux et al. 1997 ; Blanc et al. 2007 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">The SFG rickettsiae are further divided in two subgroups : the Rickettsia conorii subgroup and the R. massiliae subgroup , the latter also including Rickettsia montanensis , Rickettsia aeschlimannii , and Rickettsia rhipicephali ( Roux et al. 1997 ; Fournier et al. 1998 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">Natural resistance to rifampin is a phenotypic marker of the R. massiliae subgroup ( Drancourt and Raoult 1999 ) , whereas rickettsiae belonging to the R. conorii subgroup and the TG rickettsiae are naturally susceptible to rifampin ( Rolain et al. 1998 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S12">Many SFG rickettsiae infect and multiply in almost all organs of ticks , in particular the salivary glands , which enable the bacteria to be transmitted to vertebrate hosts during feeding ( Raoult and Roux 1997 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S13">Rickettsia massiliae was first isolated from Rhipicephalus sanguineus collected in Marseille ( France ) in 1992 ( Beati and Raoult 1993 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S14">Since then , this rickettsiae has been commonly detected in Rhipicephalus ticks from Central Africa , France , Greece , Mali , Portugal , Spain , Switzerland , and the United States ( Matsumoto et al. 2005 ; Eremeeva et al. 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S15">It is also transmitted transovarially , at least in Rhipicephalus turanicus ( Matsumoto et al. 2005 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S16">R. massiliae might be commonly associated with these worldwide-distributed ticks .</sentence>
<sentence id="S17">R. massiliae has also been recently identified in Ixodes ricinus ticks ( FernandezSoto et al. 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S18">At the beginning of the 20th century , SFG rickettsiae were recognized as human pathogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="S19">Although SFG rickettsioses are among the oldest known vector-borne diseases , they are also now recognized as emerging infections of humans ( Parola et al. 2005 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S20">In Spain where R. massiliae is prevalent in ticks , serological studies ( Cardenosa et al. 2003 ) and resistance to rifampin make this bacterium a putative agent of spotted fever .</sentence>
<sentence id="S21">Recently , R. massiliae has been reported as a human pathogen ( Vitale et al. 2005 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S22">The rickettsiae have comparatively small <term id="T11" sem="Cell_component">genomes</term> ( 1.1-1.5 Mb ) that have arisen through a recent and ongoing genome degradation process ( Andersson et al. 1998 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S23">To date , 10 complete Rickettsia genome sequences have been deposited in public databases .</sentence>
<sentence id="S24">They include the <term id="T12" sem="Cell_component">genomes</term> of two R. bellii strains ( GenBank AARC00000000 ; Ogata et al. 2006 ) , two sequences from the TG rickettsiae ( R. prowazekii [ Andersson et al. 1998 ] and R. typhi [ McLeod et al. 2004 ] ) , five sequences from the SFG group ( R. conorii [ Ogata et al. 2001 ] , Rickettsia sibirica [ Malek et al. 2004 ] , R. rickettsii [ GenBank AADJ00000000 ] , Rickettsia felis [ Ogata et al. 2005 ] and Rickettsia akarii [ GenBank AAFE00000000 ] ) , and the sequence of Rickettsia canadensis ( Eremeeva et al. 2005 ) for which the phylogenetic position is unclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="S25">Here , we report the sequencing and the primary analysis of the <term id="T13" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> of R. massiliae strain MTU5 isolated from the R. turanicus tick collected on horses in Camargues , France .</sentence>
<sentence id="S26">Recently , our group used seven Rickettsia species ( including R. massiliae ) in a large-scale comparative genomic study to investigate the evolutionary processes that shaped the <term id="T14" sem="Cell_component">chromosomes</term> of the genus ( Blanc et al. 2007 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S27">In particular , our results suggested a lack of recent horizontal gene transfer between Rickettsia species and other bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="S28">In the present analysis , a different approach allowed us to pinpoint horizontal gene transfers between Rickettsia species that were not discovered previously .</sentence>
<sentence id="S29">Results</sentence>
<sentence id="S30">Highlights of the R. massiliae <term id="T15" sem="Cell_component">genome</term></sentence>
<sentence id="S31">The <term id="T16" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> of R. massiliae is made of two <term id="T17" sem="Cell_component">replicons</term> : a 1 , 360 , 898bp <term id="T18" sem="Cell_component">circular chromosome</term> , and a 15 , 286-bp <term id="T19" sem="Cell_component">circular plasmid</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S32">After R. felis ( Ogata et al. 2005 ) , R. massiliae is the second sequenced Rickettsiales harboring a <term id="T20" sem="Cell_component">plasmid</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S33">We detected 968 protein genes on the <term id="T21" sem="Cell_component">chromosome</term> as well as 212 pseudogenes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S34">Only 26 gene products , including 21 transposases , exhibited no reciprocal best-BLAST hit in the other Rickettsia species ( BLASTP E-value &lt; 1 x 10 -5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S35">The <term id="T22" sem="Cell_component">plasmid</term> is predicted to contain 12 protein genes and a pseudogene , among which seven have homologs on the R. felis <term id="T23" sem="Cell_component">plasmid</term> and two others are related to transposable elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="S36">Thus , the R. massiliae <term id="T24" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> appears to encode only a limited number of novel functions with respect to the other Rickettsia .</sentence>
<sentence id="S37">A more detailed description of the genomic features of R. massiliae is presented in the Supplemental Material .</sentence>
<sentence id="S38">As expected from their close relatedness ( identity &gt; 98 % in coding sequence ) , the R. massiliae and R. conorii <term id="T25" sem="Cell_component">chromosomes</term> exhibit a high level of colinearity ( Fig. 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S39">However , a particular 54.6-kb segment retained our attention because it is absent in R. conorii .</sentence>
<sentence id="S40">This region contains 44 genes , including 14 <gene-or-gene-product id="G2">tra</gene-or-gene-product>-related genes that probably encode components of a <term id="T26" sem="Cell_component">type IV secretion system (</term> <term id="T27" sem="Cell_component">T4SS )</term> for <term id="T3" sem="Biological_process">conjugal DNA transfer</term> ( Ogata et al. 2005 , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S41">The relatively high number of specific <gene-or-gene-product id="G3">transposase</gene-or-gene-product> genes and pseudogenes ( 36 sequences ) suggests that R. massiliae underwent a recent expansion of transposons , a phenomenon also encountered in the <term id="T28" sem="Cell_component">chromosomes</term> of R. bellii ( 39 sequences ) and R. felis ( 66 sequences ) but not in the other sequenced Rickettsia genomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S42">Interestingly , the R. massiliae , R. bellii , and R. felis <term id="T29" sem="Cell_component">genomes</term> contain several <gene-or-gene-product id="G4">tra</gene-or-gene-product> genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S43">The recently released <term id="T30" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> of Orientia tsutsugamushi ( Cho et al. 2007 ) , a remote relative of Rickettsia species , exhibits also very high numbers of <gene-or-gene-product id="G5">transposase</gene-or-gene-product> ( &gt; 400 genes ) and <gene-or-gene-product id="G6">tra</gene-or-gene-product> genes ( 359 genes ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S44">Thus , there may be a link between the relative abundance of <gene-or-gene-product id="G7">transposase</gene-or-gene-product> genes in the Rickettsiale genomes and an active process of <term id="T4" sem="Biological_process">conjugation</term> enabling the acquisition of foreign DNA.</sentence>
<sentence id="S45">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G8">tra</gene-or-gene-product> gene cluster</sentence>
<sentence id="S46">The R. massiliae <gene-or-gene-product id="G9">tra</gene-or-gene-product> region is most similar to that of R. bellii in terms of gene order and content ( Fig. 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S47">The two segments share 25 ORFs , including the entire set of 14 <gene-or-gene-product id="G10">tra</gene-or-gene-product>-related genes and 11 ORFs encoding five unknown proteins ; a site-specific DNA adenine methylase , dam-like ; an <gene-or-gene-product id="G11">integrase</gene-or-gene-product> ; a signal transduction histidine , kinase-like ; and a spoT family protein ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S48">In addition , both species contain specific genes : the R. massiliae <gene-or-gene-product id="G12">tra</gene-or-gene-product> recently cluster contains 21 extra genes ( genes for 13 <gene-or-gene-product id="G13">transposases</gene-or-gene-product> , four unknown proteins , a toxin of a <term id="T31" sem="Cell_component">toxin-antitoxin system</term> , a phage-associated protein , a protein similar to the <gene-or-gene-product id="G14">DNA polymerase III alpha chain</gene-or-gene-product> , and an archaeal ATPase family protein ) , and R. bellii contains three specific genes ( genes for a leucine-rich protein , a <gene-or-gene-product id="G15">cassette chromosome recombinase B</gene-or-gene-product> , and <gene-or-gene-product id="G16">spoT16</gene-or-gene-product> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S49">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G17">tra</gene-or-gene-product> genes are absent in the other sequenced Rickettsia <term id="T32" sem="Cell_component">chromosomes</term> except for R. canadensis and Rickettsia africae , which contain small subsets of the R. massiliae <gene-or-gene-product id="G18">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster genes ( Fig. 2 ; Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S50">The genes surrounding the <gene-or-gene-product id="G19">tra</gene-or-gene-product> region are conserved in sequence and order in most Rickettsia species , even in those that do not possess a tra cluster region ( Supplemental Figs . S1-S7 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S51">In both R. massiliae and R. bellii , the tra cluster is flanked by an integrase gene ( tyrosine recombinase family ) and a tRNA-Val gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="S52">Many integrases specify integration of prokaryotic genetic elements into tRNA or tmRNA genes ( Williams 2002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S53">To avoid deactivation of the recipient gene ( e.g. , tRNA ) , the foreign genetic element usually carries at its integration site the same segment of gene as the one displaced .</sentence>
<sentence id="S54">After integration , the host tRNA is then split into two pieces lying at each extremity of the integrated genetic element ( see Fig. 1 in Williams 2002 for details ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S55">Consistent with such an integration process , we identified a 51-bp sequence highly similar to the 3&apos; -extremity of the tRNAVal , located 90 bp upstream from the R. massiliae integrase gene ( coordinates 707 , 321-707 , 371 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S56">In R. bellii , the 40-bp long displaced tRNA-Val segment lies 395 bp upstream from the integrase gene ( coordinates : 498 , 401-498 , 440 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S57">Thus , the <gene-or-gene-product id="G20">tra</gene-or-gene-product> regions in R. massiliae and R. bellii probably result from the integration of a site-specific integrative and conjugative element ( Burrus et al. 2002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S58">The organization of the rickettsial <gene-or-gene-product id="G21">tra</gene-or-gene-product> regions is very similar to that of the tra clusters of O. tsutsugamushi ( Cho et al. 2007 ) , including <gene-or-gene-product id="G22">tra</gene-or-gene-product>-associated genes such as transposase , <gene-or-gene-product id="G23">spoT</gene-or-gene-product> , <gene-or-gene-product id="G24">Histidine Kinase</gene-or-gene-product> , and <gene-or-gene-product id="G25">Dam</gene-or-gene-product> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S59">Overall , 29 of the 44 R. massiliae <gene-or-gene-product id="G26">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster genes have homologs in the <term id="T33" sem="Cell_component">O. tsutsugamushi</term> <term id="T34" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S60">This points to a probable common origin of those genetic elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="S61">The nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of the recombined R. massiliae tRNA-Val gene ( toward the <gene-or-gene-product id="G27">RMA_0756</gene-or-gene-product> gene ) is part of the original conjugative element that gave birth to the chromosomal <gene-or-gene-product id="G28">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster .</sentence>
<sentence id="S62">We searched for similar sequences in the downstream region of the tRNA-Val gene in all sequenced Rickettsia genomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S63">Significant matches ( BLASTN Evalue &lt; 1 x 10 -5 ) were identified not only for R. bellii , R. africae , and R. canadensis ( as expected ) but also for R. rickettsii and R. akarii , over regions that extend into the first gene ( RMA_0756 ; referred to hereafter as the U gene ) of the R. massiliae conjugative element ( Supplemental Fig . S8 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S64">Thus , these two latter species appear to contain traces of ancient integrated genetic elements , at least partly related to that of R. massiliae .</sentence>
<sentence id="S65">Out of the Rickettsia genus , homologs of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G29">U</gene-or-gene-product> gene are only found in the <term id="T35" sem="Cell_component">O. tsutsugamushi genome</term> ( 35 copies , BLASTP E-value &lt; 10 -10 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S66">In contrast , homologs are present in the R. massiliae ( RMA_p01 ) and R. felis ( pRF19 ) <term id="T36" sem="Cell_component">plasmids</term> and in the R. bellii ( RBE_1035 ) and the R. prowazekii ( pseudogene between <gene-or-gene-product id="G30">RP708</gene-or-gene-product> and <gene-or-gene-product id="G31">RP709</gene-or-gene-product> ) genomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S67">The R. prowazekii U pseudogene is located in a 12-kb region specific to R. prowazekii ( McLeod et al. 2004 ) , which also includes several transposase ( <gene-or-gene-product id="G32">RP710</gene-or-gene-product> and <gene-or-gene-product id="G33">RP715</gene-or-gene-product> ) and recombinase pseudogenes ( <gene-or-gene-product id="G34">RP711</gene-or-gene-product> ) that are uniquely found on both the R. felis and R. massiliae <term id="T37" sem="Cell_component">plasmids</term> ( Supplemental Fig . S9 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S68">In addition , this region contains a fragment of a <gene-or-gene-product id="G35">patatin-like protein gene</gene-or-gene-product> mostly similar to the <gene-or-gene-product id="G36">pat2</gene-or-gene-product> gene of the R. felis <term id="T38" sem="Cell_component">plasmid</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S69">This region might also result from the integration of a genetic element or <term id="T39" sem="Cell_component">plasmid</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S70">We also note that homologs of <gene-or-gene-product id="G37">spoT6</gene-or-gene-product> , <gene-or-gene-product id="G38">spoT16</gene-or-gene-product> , <gene-or-gene-product id="G39">spoT15</gene-or-gene-product> , and the unknown protein gene RcanM01000502 ( R. canadensis ) are organized in cluster in the R. felis <term id="T40" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> , in the same order as in the consensus structure of the Rickettsia <gene-or-gene-product id="G40">tra</gene-or-gene-product> regions ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S71">However , they lie at a <term id="T5" sem="Biological_process">location</term> remote from the tRNA-Val gene , suggesting that they do not originate from the same genetic element .</sentence>
<sentence id="S72">Thus , this analysis supports the view that integrated genetic elements are relatively widespread in Rickettsia , at least in the form of traces .</sentence>
<sentence id="S73">Phylogenetic study of the tra cluster genes</sentence>
<sentence id="S74">A previous study of the R. bellii <term id="T41" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> showed that the closest homologs of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G41">tra</gene-or-gene-product> genes outside the Rickettsia genus were found in microbes living inside amoebae , including Legionella pneumophila and Protochlamydia amoebophila ( Ogata et al. 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S75">Here we present the phylogenetic relationships of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G42">tra</gene-or-gene-product>-cluster genes among the Rickettsia species .</sentence>
<sentence id="S76">Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted for 13 homologous gene families for which sequences were present in at least three distinct Rickettsia species and with sufficient overlap ( protein alignment &gt; 75 sites ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S77">The R. felis plasmid proteins were generally difficult to align with their rickettsial homologs , suggesting that the plasmid sequences are the most distantly related .</sentence>
<sentence id="S78">This is confirmed in six phylogenetic reconstructions where plasmid proteins are separated by the longest branches from the rest of the rickettsial sequences ( Fig. 3C-H ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S79">In all cases but in the transposase tree ( Fig. 3F ) , the plasmid proteins are more distant from their rickettsial chromosomal counterparts than are the O. tsutsugamushi homologs .</sentence>
<sentence id="S80">In seven phylogenetic trees , the R. massiliae proteins are the closest homologs of the R. bellii sequences ( Fig. 3C-H , M ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S81">This phylogenetic affinity is consistent with the high level of synteny between the two regions but in disagreement with the species phylogeny ( Fig. 3A ) , in which R. bellii is the earliest diverging species and R. massiliae is anchored within the spotted fever group ( together with R. africae and R. rickettsii ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S82">Exceptions to this rule are <gene-or-gene-product id="G43">spoT6</gene-or-gene-product> ( Fig. 3I ) , <gene-or-gene-product id="G44">histidine kinase</gene-or-gene-product> ( Fig. 3K ) , and dam methylase ( Fig. 3L ) , for which the R. bellii sequences are more closely related to R. africae or R. felis than R. massiliae .</sentence>
<sentence id="S83">This phylogenetic proximity is also in disagreement with the species tree .</sentence>
<sentence id="S84">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G45">U</gene-or-gene-product> gene exhibits even more phylogenetic incongruence : the SFG rickettsiae ( R. africae , R. massiliae and R. rickettsii ) fall in three distinct lineages ( Fig. 3M ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S85">The position of R. canadensis with respect to R. massiliae and R. bellii is always consistent across the phylogenetic trees of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G46">tra</gene-or-gene-product> proteins and the <gene-or-gene-product id="G47">U</gene-or-gene-product> protein , in which it stands out as a sister group ( Fig. 3B- E , G , H , M ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S86">The striking picture emerging from this analysis is that none of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G48">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster proteins seems to present an evolutionary history compatible with a strict vertical inheritance .</sentence>
<sentence id="S87">Only two protein families ( <gene-or-gene-product id="G49">histidine kinase</gene-or-gene-product> and <gene-or-gene-product id="G50">U</gene-or-gene-product> gene ) formally rejected ( alpha = 5 % ) the species tree topology using the Shimodaira- Hasegawa ( SH ) test ( Shimodaira and Hasegawa 1999 ) ( Supplemental Table S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S88">The poor discrimination of the SH tests between alternative topologies is likely the consequence of the short length of some alignments and/or the lack of strong phylogenetic signal .</sentence>
<sentence id="S89">The departure from the species phylogeny implies that the tra-regions were subject to horizontal transfer events between rickettsiae , but other less likely scenarios such as a complex interplay of duplication/differential loss can also be invoked .</sentence>
<sentence id="S90">In this respect , the phylogenetic relationships between the U genes ( Fig. 3M ) are particularly interesting because they suggest that the genetic elements ( or traces of thereof ) result from different integration events , many of which occurred in the same tRNA-Val gene due to the integrase site specificity .</sentence>
<sentence id="S91">Furthermore , the different genes did not produce consistent phylogenies in spite of their collinear organization .</sentence>
<sentence id="S92">However , we note that the phylogenies of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G51">tra</gene-or-gene-product> genes and the <gene-or-gene-product id="G52">transposase</gene-or-gene-product> ( Fig. 3B-H ) that lie in the 5&apos; part of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G53">tra</gene-or-gene-product>-cluster are consistent between each other ( albeit with some low bootstrap supports ) , whereas the genes corresponding to the 3&apos; extremity of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G54">tra</gene-or-gene-product>-region ( <gene-or-gene-product id="G55">spoT</gene-or-gene-product> , <gene-or-gene-product id="G56">histidine kinase</gene-or-gene-product> , dam , and <gene-or-gene-product id="G57">U</gene-or-gene-product> protein ; Fig. 3I-M ) exhibit heterogeneous evolutionary histories .</sentence>
<sentence id="S93">This suggests that the original genetic elements result from the <term id="T6" sem="Biological_process">assembly</term> of gene modules with different evolutionary trajectories , a phenomenon frequently observed in conjugative genetic elements ( Burrus et al. 2002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S94">Horizontal transfer between R. massiliae and R. bellii</sentence>
<sentence id="S95">We determined the level of synonymous substitutions ( Ks ) between pairs of putative orthologous genes in R. bellii and R. massiliae .</sentence>
<sentence id="S96">All but three gene pairs falling in the tra cluster exhibit a smaller level of divergence ( Ks values from 0.01 to 0.69 ) than gene pairs in the rest of the <term id="T42" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> ( overall median Ks value of 1.58 ; Fig. 4A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S97">This indicates that those tra cluster genes were not vertically inherited from the R. bellii and R. massiliae common ancestor but rather diverged more recently .</sentence>
<sentence id="S98">One gene pair ( traDTi ) has Ks = 1.89 , a figure compatible with the overall median Ks of true orthologs .</sentence>
<sentence id="S99">The two remaining genes ( <gene-or-gene-product id="G58">histidine kinase</gene-or-gene-product> and <gene-or-gene-product id="G59">spoT6</gene-or-gene-product> genes ) have relatively high Ks values ( Ks = 2.90 and 5.57 , respectively ) and are responsible for the highest peak of the median Ks curve .</sentence>
<sentence id="S100">These two genes probably experienced different evolutionary trajectories than the rest of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G60">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster , as already evidenced in their respective phylogenetic reconstructions ( Fig. 3 , cf . I and K ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S101">These sequences diverged seemingly earlier than the split between R. bellii and R. massiliae.</sentence>
<sentence id="S102">To further investigate the origin of the <gene-or-gene-product id="G61">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster genes , we analyzed the nucleotide composition of the R. massiliae and R. bellii genes using the Bayesian method developed by Nakamura et al . ( 2004 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S103">The R. massiliae <gene-or-gene-product id="G62">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster genes have collectively a lower horizontal transfer index ( HTI ) , causing a small drop in the HTI median curve ( Fig. 4B , red curve ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S104">This indicates that these genes exhibit a poorer fit to the average genome composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="S105">Conversely , the horizontal transfer donor index ( HTDI ) median curve calculated using the R. bellii composition model exhibit a conspicuous peak centered on the <gene-or-gene-product id="G63">tra</gene-or-gene-product> region ( Fig. 4B , blue curve ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S106">This indicates that those genes have a better fit with the average R. bellii gene nucleotide composition than does the rest of the <term id="T43" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S107">In contrast , the R. bellii <gene-or-gene-product id="G64">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster genes present neither sensible deviation from the average R. bellii nucleotide composition ( HTI curve ; Fig. 4C ) nor a better fit to the R. massiliae model ( HTDI curve ; Fig. 4C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S108">Altogether , these data strongly suggest that a recent R. massiliae ancestor has acquired the <gene-or-gene-product id="G65">tra</gene-or-gene-product> gene cluster through horizontal transfer from another Rickettsia species closely related to R. bellii .</sentence>
<sentence id="S109">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G66">tra</gene-or-gene-product> regions are free from RPE</sentence>
<sentence id="S110">The R. massiliae <term id="T44" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> contains 574 identified repeated elements ( see Supplemental Material ) , most ( 98 % ) of which belong to the repeated palindromic element ( RPE ) families ( Ogata et al. 2001 ; Claverie and Ogata 2003 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S111">All Rickettsia species sequenced so far are littered with RPE sequences throughout their <term id="T45" sem="Cell_component">genomes</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S112">In R. massiliae , there is on average one repeat unit every 2.4 kb , distributed largely homogeneously across the intergenic spacers of the <term id="T46" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> and in some functional genes ( RPEs constitute most red and green dots out of the main diagonal in Fig. 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S113">Intriguingly , the tra cluster region is located within by far the largest ( 63.5 kb ) RPE-free segment of the <term id="T47" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> ( the second largest is 15.8 kb ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S114">This segment appears as an empty vertical stripe in Figure 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="S115">In R. bellii , the <gene-or-gene-product id="G67">tra</gene-or-gene-product> cluster is also part of the largest ( 45.3 kb ) RPE-free region ( average density is 1 repeat every 2.9 kb ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S116">The R. africae and R. canadensis <gene-or-gene-product id="G68">tra</gene-or-gene-product> regions also contain no RPEs .</sentence>
<sentence id="S117">The lack of RPEs is unlikely to result from strong selective pressures that forced the <gene-or-gene-product id="G69">tra</gene-or-gene-product> region to remain RPE-free , as most of the genes are not a priori involved in vital biological processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="S118">Furthermore , the intergenic regions where most of the RPEs normally lie are not smaller in the <gene-or-gene-product id="G70">tra</gene-or-gene-product> region than in the rest of the <term id="T48" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S119">Thus the absence of RPEs suggests that the primary rickettsial <gene-or-gene-product id="G71">tra</gene-or-gene-product> gene cluster was most likely acquired after the RPE proliferation in Rickettsia.</sentence>
