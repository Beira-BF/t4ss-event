<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S2">Small subunit rRNA sequences have been determined for representative strains of six species of the family Rickettsiaceae : Rickettsia rickettsii , Rickettsia prowazekii , Rickettsia typhi , Coxiella burnetii , Ehrlichia risticii , and Wolbachia persica .</sentence>
<sentence id="S3">The relationships among these sequences and those of other eubacteria show that all members of the family Rickettsiaceae belong to the so-called purple bacterial phylum .</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">The three representatives of the genus Rickettsia form a tight monophyletic cluster within the alpha subdivision of the purple bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">E. risticii also belongs to the alpha subdivision and shows a distant yet specific relationship to the genus Rickettsia .</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">However , the family as a whole is not monophyletic , in that C. burnetii and W. persica are members of the gamma subdivision .</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">The former appears to show a specific , but rather distant , relationship to the genus Legionella .</sentence>
