<sentence id="S2"><term id="T29" sem="Cell_component">Phagosomes</term> containing the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila are <term id="T2" sem="Biological_process">transported</term> to the <term id="T30" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> after macrophage internalization .</sentence>
<sentence id="S3">To modulate <term id="T3" sem="Biological_process">phagosome transport</term> , Legionella use a specialized <term id="T31" sem="Cell_component">secretion system</term> that injects bacterial proteins into eukaryotic cells .</sentence>

<sentence id="S5">Legionnaires&apos; disease</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">In the summer of 1976 , a story topping news headlines across America was on an outbreak of pneumonia claiming the lives of many attendees of a Legionnaires&apos; convention in Philadelphia ( Fraser et al. , 1977 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">What made this outbreak so terrifying was that scientists assigned to the case could not determine the cause of these deaths .</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">It wasn&apos;t until 1977 that investigators from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta announced that a new a gram-negative bacterium had been isolated from both infected patients and the air conditioning system of the hotel at which many of these individuals were staying ( McDade et al. , 1977 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">Their conclusion was that this newly isolated organism was responsible for the deadly outbreak of pneumonia that occurred at the Legionnaires&apos; convention in Philadelphia .</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">This new bacterium was appropriately named Legionella pneumophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">Human infections most often occur when aerosols containing Legionella are inhaled .</sentence>
<sentence id="S12">Legionella that gain access to the lung are internalized by alveolar macrophages where they multiply intracellularly ( Horwitz and Silverstein , 1980 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S13">If infected macrophages are not cleared quickly from the lung , a serious infection can result that leads to pneumonia and in severe instances death .</sentence>
<sentence id="S14">Legionella alter <term id="T4" sem="Biological_process"><term id="T33" sem="Cell_component">phagosome</term> transport</term></sentence>
<sentence id="S15">It is after Legionella are internalized by a phagocytic host that their pathogenic behavior is revealed ( Fig. 1 , step A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S16"><term id="T34" sem="Cell_component">Phagosomes</term> containing Legionella evade endocytic maturation ( Horwitz , 1983b ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S17">Proteins residing in late <term id="T35" sem="Cell_component">endosomes</term> or <term id="T36" sem="Cell_component">lysosomes</term> are not acquired by <term id="T37" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> harboring <term id="T157" sem="Biological_process">virulent</term> strains of <term id="T158" sem="Bacterium">Legionella</term> ( Clemens and Horwitz , 1995 ; Roy et al. , 1998 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S18">The lumenal pH of vacuoles in which Legionella reside remains neutral ( Horwitz and Maxfield , 1984 ; Sturgill-Koszycki and Swanson , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S19">It is not known how Legionella prevent vacuole acidification .</sentence>
<sentence id="S20">These bacteria may block host vacuolar ATPase function either by excluding the <term id="T38" sem="Cell_component">complex</term> or inhibiting its activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="S21">Alternatively , Legionella may take steps to neutralize their compartments as the vacuolar ATPase pumps protons into the lumen .</sentence>
<sentence id="S22">One of the most remarkable features observed for <term id="T39" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella is that 2-4 h after uptake the <term id="T40" sem="Cell_component">vacuoles</term> in which Legionella reside look nothing like the young phagosomes containing these bacteria initially .</sentence>
<sentence id="S23">These older compartments have <term id="T41" sem="Cell_component">ribosomes</term> on their surface and stain positive for resident proteins of the <term id="T42" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> ( Horwitz , 1983a ; Swanson and Isberg , 1995 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S24">It is within these <term id="T43" sem="Cell_component">ribosome-lined vacuoles</term> that Legionella replicate ( Katz and Hashemi , 1982 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S25">The morphological similarities between <term id="T44" sem="Cell_component">replicative vacuoles</term> harboring Legionella and the host ER indicate that these bacteria have devised a way to enter the <term id="T45" sem="Cell_component">ER lumen</term> by altering <term id="T5" sem="Biological_process">phagosome transport</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S26">Once in the <term id="T46" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> , they reside in an organelle rich in peptides , the primary carbon source for Legionella , and are safe from future lysosome degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="S27">Other bacterial pathogens , such as Brucella , have adopted a similar strategy and replicate within the <term id="T47" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> , indicating that the <term id="T48" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> is a desirable organelle for bacterial proliferation ( Anderson and Cheville , 1986 ; Pizarro-Cerda et al. , 1998 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S28">But how are these bacteria able to trick eukaryotic cells into transporting them to the <term id="T49" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> ? Recent studies have revealed bacterial proteins and host processes that are essential for <term id="T6" sem="Biological_process">transport</term> of Legionella to the <term id="T50" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S29">A bacterial microinjection device controls Legionella <term id="T7" sem="Biological_process">phagosome transport</term></sentence>
<sentence id="S30">Screens for intracellular growth mutants of Legionella have identified genes that play an essential role in <term id="T8" sem="Biological_process">phagosome transport</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S31">These genes are called dot ( defective organelle trafficking ) or icm ( intracellular multiplication ) ( Segal et al. , 1998 ; Vogel et al. , 1998 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S32">The dot/icm products comprise a specialized <term id="T51" sem="Cell_component">secretion apparatus</term> that can <term id="T9" sem="Biological_process">transfer</term> proteins from the <term id="T52" sem="Cell_component">cytosol</term> of Legionella into the <term id="T53" sem="Cell_component">cytosol</term> of their eukaryotic hosts ( Nagai et al. , 2002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S33">To inject proteins into eukaryotic hosts , the <term id="T54" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> must translocate substrates across the inner and outer <term id="T55" sem="Cell_component">bacterial membranes</term> and through a host cellular membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="S34">It is thought that the <term id="T56" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> must first <term id="T10" sem="Biological_process">assemble</term> a pore in the host <term id="T57" sem="Cell_component">cellular membrane</term> to serve as a conduit for <term id="T11" sem="Biological_process">protein transfer</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S35">A dot/icm-dependent activity that forms pores in <term id="T58" sem="Cell_component">host membranes</term> has been detected during Legionella infection ( Kirby et al. , 1998 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S36">This pore-forming activity allows membrane-impermeable probes added extracellularly to diffuse into eukaryotic host cells during Legionella infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="S37">Because the <term id="T59" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> is ancestrally related to <term id="T60" sem="Cell_component">type IV secretion systems</term> that mediate conjugal DNA transfer between bacteria ( Christie , 2001 ) , the pore that Legionella form in the eukaryotic <term id="T61" sem="Cell_component">cell membrane</term> is probably functioning similar to a <term id="T62" sem="Cell_component">mating channel</term> that allows the transfer of genetic material between two cells during <term id="T12" sem="Biological_process">conjugation</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S38">It is not currently known which Legionella proteins form the pores in host <term id="T63" sem="Cell_component">cellular membranes</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S39">One potential candidate is the <gene-or-gene-product id="G1">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> protein ( Berger et al. , 1994 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S40">The <term id="T64" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm system</term> secretes <gene-or-gene-product id="G2">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> protein into culture supernatant during growth of Legionella in liquid broth ( Nagai and Roy , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S41">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G3">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> protein contains seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices , and electron micrographs show that secreted <gene-or-gene-product id="G4">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> protein is part of a doughnut-shaped oligomer that one could envision functioning as <term id="T65" sem="Cell_component">a membrane channel</term> ( Roy and Isberg , 1997 ; Nagai and Roy , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S42">All mutants of Legionella that are unable to secrete <gene-or-gene-product id="G5">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> are defective in forming pores in host cellular <term id="T66" sem="Cell_component">membranes</term> ( Coers et al. , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S43">There are proteins with amino acid similarity to <gene-or-gene-product id="G6">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> found in other <term id="T67" sem="Cell_component">type IV secretion systems</term> ( Christie and Vogel , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S44">These properties make <gene-or-gene-product id="G7">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> an attractive candidate for being a component of a <term id="T68" sem="Cell_component">pore</term> or <term id="T69" sem="Cell_component">mating channel-like structure</term> that is inserted into the host cell during Legionella infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="S45">However , it can not be stated for certain that <gene-or-gene-product id="G8">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> is a pore-forming molecule because initial attempts to isolate <gene-or-gene-product id="G9">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> protein from host <term id="T70" sem="Cell_component">cellular membranes</term> have been unsuccessful .</sentence>
<sentence id="S46">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G10">icmS</gene-or-gene-product> and <gene-or-gene-product id="G11">icmW</gene-or-gene-product> genes encode interacting proteins that Legionella require for <term id="T13" sem="Biological_process">transport</term> of their <term id="T71" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> ( Coers et al. , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S47">Unlike most of the other dot/icm products , proteins encoded by <gene-or-gene-product id="G12">icmS</gene-or-gene-product> and <gene-or-gene-product id="G13">icmW</gene-or-gene-product> are not required for <gene-or-gene-product id="G14">DotA</gene-or-gene-product> <term id="T14" sem="Biological_process">secretion</term> ( Nagai and Roy , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S48">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G15">IcmS</gene-or-gene-product> and <gene-or-gene-product id="G16">IcmW</gene-or-gene-product> proteins have properties that suggest they are functioning as chaperones that assist in the <term id="T15" sem="Biological_process">secretion</term> of a distinct class of substrates by the <term id="T72" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm apparatus</term> ( Wattiau et al. , 1996 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S49">Namely , they are both small proteins ( 20 kD ) with an acidic isoelectric point that are not themselves <term id="T16" sem="Biological_process">secreted</term> by Legionella ( Zuckman et al. , 1999 ; Coers et al. , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S50">Importantly , <term id="T73" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing <gene-or-gene-product id="G17">icmS</gene-or-gene-product> or <gene-or-gene-product id="G18">icmW</gene-or-gene-product> mutants of Legionella fuse with late <term id="T74" sem="Cell_component">endosomes</term> and <term id="T75" sem="Cell_component">lysosomes</term> , indicating that the putative secreted substrates that are guided by these chaperones are essential for blocking endocytic maturation ( Fig. 1 , step B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S51">The <gene-or-gene-product id="G19">IcmR</gene-or-gene-product> protein is another chaperone required for <term id="T76" sem="Cell_component">Dot/ Icm secretion system</term> function ( Coers et al. , 2000 ; Dumenil and Isberg , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S52">Approximately half of the <term id="T77" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing <gene-or-gene-product id="G20">icmR</gene-or-gene-product> mutants of Legionella manage to evade immediate endocytic maturation after macrophage uptake ; however , these <term id="T78" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> do not support robust replication of Legionella and are <term id="T17" sem="Biological_process">transported</term> to lysosomes eventually ( Coers et al. , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S53">Thus , the <term id="T18" sem="Biological_process">phagosome transport</term> phenotype of an <gene-or-gene-product id="G21">icmR</gene-or-gene-product> mutant is quite different than that of <gene-or-gene-product id="G22">icmS</gene-or-gene-product> or <gene-or-gene-product id="G23">icmW</gene-or-gene-product> mutants , suggesting that formation of a replicative vacuole by Legionella requires evasion of endocytic maturation and a second event that requires at least one additional protein that the <term id="T79" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> injects into host cells ( Fig. 1 , step C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S54">Host vesicles associate rapidly with Legionella <term id="T80" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term></sentence>
<sentence id="S55">Marcus Horwitz made the initial observation in 1983 that young <term id="T81" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella are surrounded by smooth vesicles ( Horwitz , 1983a ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S56">Recently , this phenomenon was examined more closely ( Tilney et al. , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S57">It was found that shortly after uptake host vesicles come in contact with Legionella <term id="T82" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S58">As host vesicles make contact with <term id="T83" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella they begin to flatten along the surface of the <term id="T84" sem="Cell_component">phagosome membrane</term> ( Fig. 2 A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S59">Periodic threads that bridge the space between the <term id="T85" sem="Cell_component">phagosome</term> and host <term id="T86" sem="Cell_component">vesicle membranes</term> are clearly visible by EM , suggesting that a receptor-mediated &quot;zippering&quot; event may be driving this intimate interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="S60">Host vesicles begin to associate with the basal surface of <term id="T87" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella within 5 min of uptake , and 90 % of the <term id="T88" sem="Cell_component">phagosome surface</term> is covered by host vesicles within 15 min ( Fig. 1 , step D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S61">Initially , the host vesicles have a lipid bilayer that is noticeably thinner than that of the <term id="T89" sem="Cell_component">plasma membrane-derived phagosome</term> harboring Legionella .</sentence>
<sentence id="S62">However , the <term id="T90" sem="Cell_component">membrane</term> surrounding wild-type Legionella rapidly thins and becomes the same thickness as the bilayer of the <term id="T91" sem="Cell_component">host vesicles</term> that have become attached .</sentence>
<sentence id="S63">This membrane conversion event suggests that the interaction with host vesicles results in a flux of either lipids or proteins from the <term id="T92" sem="Cell_component">phagosome membrane</term> surrounding Legionella .</sentence>
<sentence id="S64">After 4 h , as Horwitz reported initially , there are fewer <term id="T93" sem="Cell_component">host vesicles</term> associated with vacuoles containing Legionella .</sentence>
<sentence id="S65">Instead , there are <term id="T94" sem="Cell_component">ribosomes</term> attached to the exposed regions of the <term id="T95" sem="Cell_component">vacuole membrane</term> where host vesicles were found earlier ( Fig. 2 B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S66">Thus , at this time Legionella have established residence in an <term id="T96" sem="Cell_component">ER-like organelle</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S67">Host vesicles do not attach to <term id="T97" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing most dot/icm mutants of Legionella , indicating that host vesicle attachment requires a factor secreted by the <term id="T98" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm apparatus</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S68">Interestingly , <term id="T99" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing <gene-or-gene-product id="G24">icmS</gene-or-gene-product> or <gene-or-gene-product id="G25">icmW</gene-or-gene-product> mutants of Legionella still recruit host vesicles and their <term id="T100" sem="Cell_component">phagosomal membrane</term> thins .</sentence>
<sentence id="S69">The fact that these <term id="T101" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> fuse with late <term id="T102" sem="Cell_component">endosomes</term> and <term id="T103" sem="Cell_component">lysosomes</term> indicates that the ability of Legionella to evade immediate endocytic maturation can not be explained simply by attached host vesicles remodeling these <term id="T104" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> or constructing a barricade that prevents endocytic maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="S70">In support of the hypothesis that evasion of lysosome fusion by Legionella occurs independently of host vesicle recruitment , it was found that phagosomes containing <gene-or-gene-product id="G26">icmR</gene-or-gene-product> mutants that have evaded endocytic maturation remain naked , and due to the absence of host vesicles attached to their surface , the <term id="T105" sem="Cell_component">phagosomal membrane</term> does not thin .</sentence>
<sentence id="S71">These data indicate that the protein ( s ) injected into host cells that mediate evasion of endocytic maturation are distinct from those that recruit host vesicles .</sentence>
<sentence id="S72">Thus , the delay in endocytic maturation observed for <term id="T106" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella is an event that buys precious time necessary for these bacteria to remodel their <term id="T107" sem="Cell_component">phagosome</term> by a slower process that involves subverting the <term id="T19" sem="Biological_process">transport</term> of host vesicles .</sentence>
<sentence id="S73">Legionella inject a protein into host cells that activates ADP ribosylation factor</sentence>
<sentence id="S74">Ribosomes can be seen on many of the <term id="T108" sem="Cell_component">host vesicles</term> attached to <term id="T109" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella .</sentence>
<sentence id="S75">These vesicles also stain positive for <gene-or-gene-product id="G27">protein disulfide isomerase</gene-or-gene-product> ( unpublished data ) , which is a soluble protein that resides primarily in the <term id="T110" sem="Cell_component">ER lumen</term> but can also be found in vesicles that cycle between the <term id="T111" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> and Golgi ( Ferrari and Soling , 1999 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S76">Thus , the vesicles being recruited to <term id="T112" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella are <term id="T113" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> derived .</sentence>
<sentence id="S77">In addition to <term id="T114" sem="Cell_component">ER vesicles</term> , a recent study found that the host protein <gene-or-gene-product id="G28">ADP ribosylation factor ( ARF ) 1</gene-or-gene-product> is recruited to <term id="T115" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing Legionella ( Nagai et al. , 2002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S78">ARF proteins are highly conserved small <term id="T156" sem="Molecular_function">GTP-binding</term> proteins that regulate several <term id="T20" sem="Biological_process">membrane transport processes</term> in eukaryotic cells ( Donaldson and Jackson , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S79"><gene-or-gene-product id="G29">ARF1</gene-or-gene-product> stimulates the formation of <term id="T116" sem="Cell_component">COPI-coated vesicles</term> , which are essential for vesicular transport of cargo proteins between the <term id="T117" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> and <term id="T118" sem="Cell_component">Golgi</term> ( Barlowe , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S80">Although a role for <gene-or-gene-product id="G30">ARF1</gene-or-gene-product> in the <term id="T21" sem="Biological_process">transport</term> of <term id="T119" sem="Cell_component">endocytic vesicles</term> has been described ( Gu and Gruenberg , 2000 ) , <term id="T120" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> containing dot/icm mutants of Legionella do not stain positive for <gene-or-gene-product id="G31">ARF1</gene-or-gene-product> as they are <term id="T22" sem="Biological_process">transported</term> through the <term id="T121" sem="Cell_component">endocytic pathway</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S81">Thus , <gene-or-gene-product id="G32">ARF1</gene-or-gene-product> is observed only on Legionella phagosomes in transit to the <term id="T122" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> , and recruitment of <gene-or-gene-product id="G33">ARF1</gene-or-gene-product> requires the <term id="T123" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S82">From these data it was predicted that wild-type Legionella may encode an <gene-or-gene-product id="G34">ARF1</gene-or-gene-product>-interacting protein that is injected into macrophages by the <term id="T124" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S83">This hypothesis was correct .</sentence>
<sentence id="S84">Analysis of the Legionella <term id="T125" sem="Cell_component">genome</term> revealed a protein that has a 200 amino acid region homologous to the catalytic domain found in all eukaryotic proteins that function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) for ARF ( Nagai et al. , 2002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S85">This conserved catalytic region is known as the <gene-or-gene-product id="G35">Sec7</gene-or-gene-product> homology domain ( Jackson and Casanova , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S86">Like eukaryotic proteins that contain <gene-or-gene-product id="G36">Sec7</gene-or-gene-product> homology domains , this Legionella protein activates ARF in vitro by stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP .</sentence>
<sentence id="S87">This Legionella ARF-GEF was called <gene-or-gene-product id="G37">RalF</gene-or-gene-product> because it was found to be required for the recruitment of ARF to the Legionella <term id="T126" sem="Cell_component">phagosome</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S88">As predicted , the <gene-or-gene-product id="G38">RalF</gene-or-gene-product> protein is injected into macrophages by a process requiring the <term id="T127" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S89">Even though Legionella <gene-or-gene-product id="G39">ralF</gene-or-gene-product> mutants are <term id="T23" sem="Biological_process">transported</term> in <term id="T128" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> that do not stain positive for <gene-or-gene-product id="G40">ARF1</gene-or-gene-product> , these <term id="T129" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> still evade fusion with <term id="T130" sem="Cell_component">lysosomes</term> and mature into <term id="T131" sem="Cell_component">vacuoles</term> that support intracellular replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="S90">Thus , the <gene-or-gene-product id="G41">RalF</gene-or-gene-product> protein is not essential for <term id="T24" sem="Biological_process">transport</term> of Legionella to the <term id="T132" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S91">So why would Legionella inject an exchange factor for ARF into eukaryotic hosts during infection ?</sentence>
<sentence id="S92">It is likely that the function of <gene-or-gene-product id="G42">RalF</gene-or-gene-product> is to stimulate normal host processes that Legionella subvert during biogenesis of an <term id="T133" sem="Cell_component">ER vacuole</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S93">Accordingly , <gene-or-gene-product id="G43">RalF</gene-or-gene-product> may play a role in the creation or transport of <term id="T134" sem="Cell_component">ER vesicles</term> that associate with Legionella <term id="T135" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> shortly after uptake .</sentence>
<sentence id="S94">The reason <gene-or-gene-product id="G44">RalF</gene-or-gene-product> function is not required by Legionella during infection of host cells cultured in the laboratory may be because <term id="T136" sem="Cell_component">ER vesicles</term> that <term id="T25" sem="Biological_process">transport</term> cargo to the <term id="T137" sem="Cell_component">Golgi</term> are created constitutively in healthy cells growing in nutritionally rich medium .</sentence>
<sentence id="S95">However , in nature Legionella is likely to encounter protozoan hosts that are conserving energy and are less active metabolically .</sentence>
<sentence id="S96">Under these conditions , host ARF-GEFs are likely down-regulated , reducing vesicular transport between the <term id="T138" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> and <term id="T139" sem="Cell_component">Golgi</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S97">By injecting their own ARF exchange factor during infection , Legionella may be able to stimulate the creation of the ER- <term id="T140" sem="Cell_component">Golgi transport vesicles</term> these bacteria require to remodel their <term id="T141" sem="Cell_component">phagosomes</term> .</sentence>

<sentence id="S99">In conclusion , these data provide evidence that in addition to <gene-or-gene-product id="G45">RalF</gene-or-gene-product> Legionella must be injecting additional proteins into macrophages that bind <term id="T142" sem="Cell_component">ER vesicles</term> and promote <term id="T143" sem="Cell_component">phagosome</term> remodeling .</sentence>
<sentence id="S100">One possibility is that these undiscovered bacterial proteins function similar to SNARE proteins that mediate tethering and fusion of <term id="T144" sem="Cell_component">ER vesicles</term> with downstream secretory organelles such as the <term id="T145" sem="Cell_component">ER Golgi</term> intermediate compartment or the cis-Golgi ( Guo et al. , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S101">Curiously , the studies in which <term id="T146" sem="Cell_component">ER vesicles</term> were found attached to Legionella phagosomes also showed <term id="T147" sem="Cell_component">ER vesicles</term> attached to the <term id="T148" sem="Cell_component">plasma membrane</term> of uninfected macrophages by periodic threads similar to those seen at the ER-Legionella phagosome interface ( Tilney et al. , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S102">Perhaps what these data are telling us is that Legionella are subverting a host pathway to the <term id="T149" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> that is not well understood or appreciated - a road less traveled .</sentence>
<sentence id="S103">There have been recent studies suggesting that <term id="T150" sem="Cell_component">ER membrane</term> may contribute to the formation of vacuoles formed during phagocytosis ( Garin et al. , 2001 ; MullerTaubenberger et al. , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="S104">Thus , investigations on Legionella <term id="T26" sem="Biological_process">phagosome transport</term> could provide important details on a process by which <term id="T151" sem="Cell_component">plasma membrane-derived vesicles</term> can be <term id="T27" sem="Biological_process">transported</term> to the <term id="T152" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S105">Regardless of the mechanism , one thing is certain : determining the function of proteins injected by the <term id="T153" sem="Cell_component">Dot/Icm secretion system</term> will further our knowledge on normal vesicular <term id="T154" sem="Cell_component">transport pathways</term> that lead to the <term id="T155" sem="Cell_component">ER</term> .</sentence>
