<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S2">Genetic modification of plant cells by Agrobacterium is the only known natural example of <term id="T1" sem="Biological_process">DNA transport</term> between kingdoms .</sentence>
<sentence id="S3">While the bacterial factors involved in Agrobacterium infection have been relatively well characterized , studies of their host cellular partners are just beginning .</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">Here , we describe the plant cell factors that might participate in Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation and discuss their possible roles in this process .</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Because Agrobacterium probably adapts existing cellular processes for its life cycle , identifying the host factors participating in Agrobacterium infection might contribute to a better understanding of such basic biological processes as cell communication , <term id="T2" sem="Biological_process">intracellular transport</term> and DNA repair and recombination as well as help expand the host range of Agrobacterium as a genetic engineering tool .</sentence>
