<sentence id="S3">The virB operon of <term id="N5" sem="Bacterium">A. tumefaciens</term> encodes 11 proteins , of which 9 are known to be located in the <term id="T9" sem="Cell_component">membranes</term> and 10 have been shown to be essential for <term id="T2" sem="Biological_process">virulence</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">Sequence comparisons between proteins encoded by the virB operon and those encoded by operons from <term id="T10" sem="Cell_component">conjugative plasmids</term> indicated that VirB proteins may form a structure similar to a <term id="T11" sem="Cell_component">conjugative pilus</term> .</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Here , we examine the effects of mutations in <gene-or-gene-product id="G7">virB4</gene-or-gene-product> on the accumulation and <term id="T3" sem="Biological_process">localization</term> of other <term id="N3" sem="Protein_family_or_group">VirB proteins</term> .</sentence>

<sentence id="S7">Polar and nonpolar <gene-or-gene-product id="G13">virB4</gene-or-gene-product> mutants were examined , and all were shown to be unable to accumulate <gene-or-gene-product id="G14">VirB3</gene-or-gene-product> protein to wild-type levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">A low level of <gene-or-gene-product id="G15">VirB3</gene-or-gene-product> protein which was present in induced NT1RE cells harboring <gene-or-gene-product id="G16">virB4</gene-or-gene-product> nonpolar mutant pBM1130 was found to associate with the <term id="T13" sem="Cell_component">inner membrane</term> fraction only , whereas in wild-type cells <gene-or-gene-product id="G17">VirB3</gene-or-gene-product> associated with both inner and <term id="T14" sem="Cell_component">outer membranes</term> .</sentence>
